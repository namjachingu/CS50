## Scrabble

In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.

For example, if we wanted to score the word Code, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the C is worth 3 points, the o is worth 1 point, the d is worth 2 points, and the e is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that Code is worth 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 points.

The program determines the winner of a scrabble game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins. The program prompts two players for their words.
