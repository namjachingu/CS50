Recreate pyramids from Nintendo's Super Mario Brother using hashes (#) for bricks. The program allows the user to decide how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between 1 and 8. 

Here’s how the program works if the user inputs 4 when prompted:


       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######

If the user doesn’t input a positive integer between 1 and 8, then the program re-prompts the user until they cooperate.
