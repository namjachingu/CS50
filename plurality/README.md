## Plurality

Elections come in all shapes and sizes. A common method is the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

Plurality is a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.
